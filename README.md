The Smile project is new way to develop rich and interactive online experiments. Smile prioritizes modularity and reusability. Unlike tools that cater to non-programmers, Smile is designed to help reasonably competent programmers accomplish more in less time.

### Highlighted features:

- 🌈 Fast and fun front-end interface development with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org),
  [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and
  [Shadcn/vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/). Make complex games, animations, and
  surveys with ease.
- 👩‍💻 Custom [API](https://smile.gureckislab.org/api) and [developer mode tools](https://smile.gureckislab.org/coding/developing) which
  provides a novel interface for specifying and debugging interactive
  experiments. Jump quickly between phases and trials in your experiments,
  [autofill forms and generate mock data for testing](https://smile.gureckislab.org/coding/autofill),
  [hot-reload](https://smile.gureckislab.org/coding/developing#hot-module-replacement) the code you are
  working on without restarting the entire experiment, and more!
- 🧩 Built-in support for
  [common experiment elements](https://smile.gureckislab.org/coding/views#built-in-views) like consent forms,
  instructions, and surveys. Just add your custom experiment logic and start
  collecting data.
- 🤖 Code writing can be greatly accelerated using AI tools because LLMs are
  trained on extensive codebases covering Vue, Tailwind, and other popular web
  standards used by the project.
- 👫 Built-in support for multiple [recruitment services](https://smile.gureckislab.org/recruit/recruitment)
  including Prolific, MTurk, CloudResearch, and more.
- 📝 [Data provenance features](https://smile.gureckislab.org/analysis#data-provenance) include an audit trail
  of which version of the code was used to create each data file.
- 😎 Great looking and detailed docs, if we do say so ourselves!

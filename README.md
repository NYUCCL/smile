# Smile

A head-meltingly happy approach to online behavioral research.

The Smile project is new way to develop rich and interactive online experiments. Smile prioritizes modularity and reusability. Unlike tools that cater to non-programmers, Smile is designed to help reasonably competent programmers accomplish more in less time.

### Highlighted features:

- Fast and fun front-end interface development with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org),
  [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and
  [Shadcn/vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/). Make complex games, animations, and
  surveys with ease.
- Custom API and developer mode tools which
  provides a novel interface for specifying and debugging interactive
  experiments.
- Built-in support for
  common experiment elements like consent forms,
  instructions, and surveys. Just add your custom experiment logic and
  start collecting data.
- Basic component library which helps you quickly design and
  layout elements.
- Participant-friendly features include the ability to withdraw from the
  experiment (while providing feedback), incremental data saving, optimized load
  times, ability to resume from where you left off even if reloading the pages,
  and graceful error handling and a responsive design that works on most/all
  devices.
- Developer mode which makes it easier to debug and design
  experiments. Jump quickly between phases and trials in your experiments,
  autofill forms and generate mock data for testing,
  hot-reload the code you are
  working on without restarting the entire experiment, and more!
- Use Vue's declarative programming and reactive data binding
  to simplify your coding.
- Code writing can be greatly accelerated using AI tools because LLMs are
  trained on extensive codebases covering Vue, Tailwind, and other popular web
  standards used by the project.
- Built-in support for multiple recruitment services
  including Prolific, MTurk, CloudResearch, and more.
- Secure data storage and retrieval using a flexible, but easy-to-use
  database API based on
  Google Firestore and and Real-time Database.
- Automatic and highly reproducible deployment of the
  latest code to the web using
  GitHub Actions.
- Data provenance features include an audit trail
  of which version of the code was used to create each data file.

_Initial development was supported by National Science Foundation Grant [BCS-2121102](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2121102&HistoricalAwards=false) to TM Gureckis._

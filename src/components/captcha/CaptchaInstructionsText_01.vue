      Before we begin we'd like you to solve a couple quick problems for us, just to warm up your brain. They are common
      sense questions and tasks that should be easy and fun if you are a human and paying attention.
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-left">
      Each question will need to be answered <b>as quickly as possible</b>. If you don't respond in time it will move to
      the next question.
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-left">
      Before we begin we will give you practice with one of the tasks so you can see how it works. Your answer for this
      one doesn't matter.

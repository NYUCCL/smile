# Adding a new user to the organization

If your lab already has a base repo, you can skip all of the configuration steps
yourself! Instead, here are a few steps for you and the Smile coordinator of
your lab to take in order to add your profile to the organization.

## On the user end

### 1. Github access

Tell the main Smile coordinator for your lab your username so they can add you
as a member of the lab's Github organization.

### 2. Request access to the shared configuration files

You need to get access to the .env files specific for your lab (env/.env.local,
env/.env.deploy.local, env/.env.docs.local)/ These should be stored someplace in
your lab like a fileserver, slack channel or even distributed over email.

::: info Great news!

You only need to do this the first time you try out <SmileText/>! Then you will
forever be part of the family. For each new project you want to use with this
lab copy the relevant .env files over.

## Testing access

For a new user to test if they have the correct permissions to the organization,
they should proceed with [starting a new project](/starting).

There are two ways to get started with Smile depending on your situation.

1. If you are already using Smile in your lab, install the
   [required software](/requirements) to get started developing your own
   experiments.
1. If you are setting up Smile for the first time use in your lab, jump to the
   [lab config](/labconfig) docs for configuring your services.

The design choices in Smile were made so that it is relatively painless for
developers to make new experiments after your lab performs the one-time setup.
This handy flow chart gives an overview of the process:

# Developing your experiments

When developing and debugging your experiment, it is useful to interact with a
web server running on your local computer (i.e., your laptop or desktop). This
is much faster than waiting for changes to upload to the cloud and then having
your browser download the files again.

In <SmileText/>, this is all handled by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). Vite is a
development tool that is heavily optimized for developer experience (DX). There
is a lot to say about the features of Vite, but more directly, to test your
application locally simply type:

```sh
npm run dev
```

in the project folder. You should see something like this:

```sh
  vite v2.9.9 dev server running at:

  > Local: http://localhost:3000/
  > Network: use `--host` to expose

  ready in 283ms.
```

If you open the link shown after `Local:` (in this case,
`http://localhost:3000/`) in your browser[^mac], it will show you a live demo of
your web experiment. This website will automatically refresh and change as you
make modifications to your code. That's all you need to get started.

[^mac]:
    On Mac, if you press the Command (âŒ˜) key while clicking the link, it will
    open in a new tab.

## Smile developer tools

When you are viewing your website in developer mode, there are special UI
elements that help you debug and develop your experiments. Here's an example
video from a recent build (v0.1.0):

<video controls autoplay loop muted poster="https://todd.gureckislab.org/images/blog/smile-0.1.0-devmode.png" style="max-width:100%;width:700px;">
  <source src="https://todd.gureckislab.org/videos/blog/smile-0.1.0-devmode.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

The developer tools let you:

- Inspect the state of your running experiment, including configuration settings
  and your current data
- Jump between sections of your experiment (i.e., [Views](/coding/views))
- Pin certain Views/pages so that you can focus on them without restarting the
  entire task
- View errors and warning messages
- Autofill forms and experiment data to generate simulated data for testing your
  analysis scripts
- Simulate how your task will appear on different size monitors and devices like
  phones
- Toggle between light/dark mode
  ([if you choose to support it](/styling/darkmode))
- Debug the step-by-step operation of your experiment
- Perform "brain surgery" by forcing particular settings or events to happen to
  see how your experiment responds.

## Testing the build process

You can also test the build process locally. Simply type:

```
npm run build
```

If the build is successful, the files will be bundled exactly as they will be on
your final deployed website. (Files go into the `dist/` folder, which is not
tracked by git).

Next, you can view the website almost exactly as it will appear online by
typing:

```
npm run preview
```

## Hot Module Replacement

One of the most useful features of Vite in development mode is that it
automatically reloads the webpage any time changes are made to any project
files. This prevents you from having to go back and forth between your editor
and the browser and manually refreshing the browser window.

[Some tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
provide this automatic updating by forcing the entire browser webpage to reload
anytime a file changes.

However, the downside of reloading the site page each time there is a change is
that the "state" of the page is reset. For example, if you were testing your
experiment and were on trial 10, paused, and then changed the color of one of
the fonts, most live-reloaders will completely reload the page, taking you back
to the first trial of the experiment (i.e., the state is reset).

Instead, Vite can reload modules for parts of a page without reloading the
_entire_ page. This can be **very powerful** for developing experiments because
it can prevent a lot of mindless clicking just to get back to a particular state
and trigger an error, etc. Once you understand this difference, you'll wonder
how you ever programmed for the web without it. This feature is known as
[Hot Module Replacement](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement).

## Bundling, Tree-Shaking, and Code-splitting

A second key feature of Vite is that it acts as a bundler. When you use complex
libraries in your project, there may be lots of dependencies both within and
between packages. As one example, the popular [lodash](https://lodash.com)
library organizes all the functions into individual modules, so importing the
lodash library in Node.js technically may load as many as 600 other files at
once. If this was running on a real webserver, the number of separate requests
might overload the server. As a result, modern websites "bundle" the required
code into a single, optimized file so that only one file is imported. Vite does
this behind the scenes for you both in development and build mode.

There are several other features of Vite, including a process called
[Tree-Shaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking),
which removes functions from the bundle that are not used in the current app to
reduce the file size, and
[Code Splitting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Code_splitting),
which organizes files into "chunks" that reflect common dependencies across
different pages of a site.

## Merging changes to the template into your existing project

Because Smile is still being developed, there may be changes to the Smile
template after you begin setting up your own project. If you want to merge those
changes into your own project, follow these steps:

First, you need to make sure that your organization's fork of the Smile template
(the base Smile repo for your organization) has the latest version of Smile.

Once the Smile admin for your lab has merged any changes with your own lab's
base repo, you can follow these steps to merge the changes into your own
project.

The first time you want to get changes from the Smile template, you need to add
the base Smile repo for your lab as a new remote. For example, if your lab
organization is called `NYUCCL` on Github and the template repo is called
`smile`, you'd type the following command:

```
git remote add smile https://github.com/NYUCCL/smile.git
```

You only need to do this once. Next time, the Smile template will already be
added as a remote.

Next, fetch the current template from the Smile repo:

```
git fetch smile
```

If this is your first time merging changes from the template, create a branch
called smile_template in your project, and switch to that branch:

```
git checkout -b smile_template
```

If you've done this before, the branch already exists, so just switch to the
branch:

```
git checkout smile_template
```

Then, merge the main branch of the current smile template into the
smile_template branch, and push the changes in smile_template to origin:

```
git merge smile/main --allow-unrelated-histories -X theirs
git push
```

Make a new branch called update, based off the current branch your study is
being developed on:

```
git checkout -b update
```

Merge the smile_template branch into update, and resolve conflicts:

```
git merge smile_template
```

Merge update into your experiment's branch, for example called main:

```
git checkout main
git merge update
```

Voila, your Smile has been updated to be even bigger! The extra step (creating
another additional update branch) prevented the entire commit history of the
NYUCCL/smile repository from being added to your project, which helps keep
things nice and clean.

Finally, you should re-run node's package installer in case any of the required
packages changed:

```
npm i
```

# :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Timeline and Design File

Web experiments are often composed of several parts presented in sequence. For
example, we might show a welcome page &rarr; informed consent &rarr;
instructions &rarr; etc. <SmileText /> provides a central "sequencing" feature
which makes it easy to configure, customize, and move through different stages
of an experiment. We call this the **"timeline."**

The timeline feature is more than just a way to control the presentation order
of different phases. It also acts as a way to prevent subjects from doing things
in the tasks that you might not want. For example, in many web-based experiments
if the subject reloads the webpage the task will start over. Although
researchers often add a warning about this, it would allow subjects to repeat
the instructions after seeing the task, accidentally participate in multiple
conditions, or start over if they make a mistake to increase their bonus.
Smile's timeline logic prevents this by controlling the flow of the experiment
even across reloads of the webpage. For instance, when properly configured, a
subject in a Smile experiment can close their browser, restart their computer,
and come back to the experiment on the **same trial** they left off on.

This page shows how to configure and control <SmileText />'s timeline
implementation, and how to customize it with more complex behaviors.

## The Design File (`user/design.js`)

Perhaps the most important user-configurable file in a <SmileText /> experiment
is the design file located in `src/user/design.js`. This file is where you
configure the timeline of your experiment. You can take a look at the
[default version](https://github.com/NYUCCL/smile/blob/main/src/user/design.js)
of this file which is short, self-explanatory, and well commented.

The design file sets up the sequence of [Views](/views) that the participant
will encounter, and it can configure
[Branching/Randomized Flows](/timeline#branching-and-randomized-flows) if needed
to create different timelines for different experimental conditions. **It is
very likely you will need to edit this file to create your experiment**!

The following sections of this page describe the technical details of the
Timeline object and how to configure your design file.

## Single-page Applications and Routing

Moany modern apps such as <SmileText/> are what are known as **Single-page
Applications (SPAs)**. Rather than having content spread across multiple HTML
pages, these apps load a single HTML page and then use a Javascript framework to
control the dynamic interactions of the page including showing and hiding
different elements, handling events like clicks, loading data to or from a
server, etc... However, it is often useful to be able to directly access
different content in a web app using URLs. For example, users might want to
bookmark the login or settings page of a web app, so they need a distinct URL
that will pull each of these views up.

Because SPAs load the entire app from a single URL, the solution to this for
SPAs is known as a **router**. A router is a piece of software running in the
browser which interprets URL requests and programmatically changes the visible
content on the webpage, mimicking normal browser requests for specific pages. In
<SmileText/>, routing is handled by the [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org),
which is a powerful open-source project built for routing in
[Vue](https://vuejs.org) applications.

<SmileText/> does all of the router set-up for you, so
[all you need to do](/timeline#timeline) is provide a list of Views, as well as
any logic that connects them to each other. However, if you want to learn more
about the Vue router, you can check out the Vue Router
[documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/#javascript).

## URLs and Routes

A quick note about URLs and routes. We sometimes mention a base path or base URL
for a project. This is the full deployment URL to your experiment including the
protocol (`http://`), the domain (`exps.gureckislab.org`), as well as subfolders
(`/ghuser/repo/branch/`) etc... For example, `http://exps.gureckislab.org/`
might be the base path. This is configured via the `VITE_CODE_NAME_DEPLOY_URL`
or `VITE_DEPLOY_URL` in the `env/.env.git` file (see the docs on
[configuration](/configuration)).

Routes are configured beneath this base URL so `/` means the original base URL
but `/about` means `http://exps.gureckislab.org/#/about`. The base URL can also
include subfolders so for instance the base route could just as easily be
`https://exps.gureckislab.org/ghuser/repo/branch/#/about`. The base folder is
where your `index.html` for the SPA is located during deployment or development.

The `#` character in these URLs is not a typo. When you access a URL with
slashes on it typically it is interpreted by the browser as a new network
request for a particular resource on the webserver. An exception is for content
that follows `#` character which indicates a link to different content on the
**same page** (e.g., read about the `<a name>` tag also known as
[fragment identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/intro/intro.html#fragment-uri)
in HTML). Changes to this part of the URL do not trigger page reloads
ordinarily.

The easiest way to think about it is like this:

![how route URLS are processed](/images/routing.png)

Words that are separated by slashes appearing before the `#` (or everything, if
there are no `#`s) are sent by the browser to the web server as resource
requests using standard `http` protocol, which triggers a page reload from the
server. Things that appear after the `#` do _not_ trigger a page reload. The Vue
Router interprets changes appearing after the `#`, parses the content, and uses
it to determine what Vue components to load (based on the routing table that you
configure).[^hash]

[^hash]:
    The `VueRouter.createWebHashHistory()` call is what tells the router to use
    the `#` navigation strategy.

In <SmileText/>, key steps in the experiment are indexed by routes that map to
page-level components called [Views](/views). So `/consent` would load the
consent View and `/debrief` would load the debriefing View. This is good
organization but also helpful for [debugging/developing](/developermode) since
you can easily jump to different sections of the task.

## Timeline

As just described, the Vue Router is a mapping between different URLs and Vue
components (i.e., Views) to load. However, in experiments, we often want to step
through content sequentially. For this purpose, Smile implements a simple
Timeline class (see `src/timeline.js`) which acts as a wrapper around the basic
Vue Router.

The timeline class allows you to configure a sequence of Views as well as allow
for Views that are not part of a sequence:

<img src="/images/timeline.png" width="500" alt="timeline example" style="margin: auto;">

Sequential Views are accessed in a timeline. Non-sequential Views are not part
of that timeline.

### The View object

Each View is specified by a javascript object, which usually contains at least
the following fields:

```js
{
  name: 'my_name',
  component: MyViewComponent,
  meta: { ... },  // optional
}
```

By default, if you do not provide a `path` in the object (as in the example
above), the client-side route will be automatically set to match the name. For
example, the path in the example above would be set to `/my_name`. See details
in the `vue-router`
[documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/named-routes.html) for
more information on `name` vs. `path`. The `component` field specifies the
[View component](/views) that should be loaded when the route is requested.

If you'd like to specify a different path (that doesn't match the name), you can
do that:

```js
{
  name: 'my_name',
  path: '/testcomponent'
  component: MyViewComponent,
  meta: { ... },  // optional
}
```

The `meta` field specifies additional optional information about the View:

- It can be used to specify different previous and next Views, in case the
  experiment timeline flow branches (see
  [Branching and randomized flows](#branching-and-randomized-flows) for more
  details).
- It can also be used to allow direct navigation to particular Views, which can
  allow for unconditional navigation by setting `allowAlways: true` in the
  `meta`.
- It can be used to block access to particular Views until the user has
  consented to the study (`requiresConsent: true`) as well as only showing
  content when the user is "done" with the experiment (`requiresDone: true`).
  Another option (`requiresWithdraw: true`) requires the participant to have
  withdrawn from the page before showing.
- It can be used to set a particular state when leaving a View (e.g.
  `meta: { setDone: true },` will set the `done` state to `true` before entering
  the next View). Similarly `meta: { setConsented: true }` will set the
  `consented` state before entering the next View. These are provided in the
  timeline to make it more obvious when consent or completion has occurred in
  your timeline.

::: warning IMPORTANT

It is important that your timeline (`design.js`) actually uses
`meta: { setDone: true }` and `meta: { setConsented: true }` so that other
aspects of your experiment work correctly. For instance the `setConsented` is
used to create an initial database record for the subject. If this step is
passed the data will not be created. Similarly repeat participation is
controlled by the `done` state. If this is not set correctly the subject be
prevented from starting the experiment again or not access the final page.

:::

### Creating a timeline

A timeline is created like this:

```js
import Timeline from '@/core/timeline' // note that the '@' resolves to /src in Smile
const timeline = new Timeline()
```

There are four key methods available on the timeline instance:

### `timeline.pushSeqView(view_obj)`

Pushes a new View (specified in `view_obj`) into the sequential timeline. The
first call to this function will make the configured View the first View in the
sequence, the second call will make it the second View in the sequence, and so
on. The format of `view_obj` should correspond to the
[View object](/timeline#the-view-object) discussed above.

### `timeline.registerView(view_obj)`

This registers a new View (specified in `view_obj`) without adding it to the
timeline. This View will exist in the Vue router but will not be in the timeline
sequence. This is useful for configuration and debugging Views, as well as View
you want to define and even link to but not present in the regular timeline
flow. The notation `registerView`, as opposed to the `push...` method, is meant
to indicate that the View is not part of the sequence.

### `timeline.build()`

This should be called to construct the sequence. It takes the configured
timeline and figures out which View is the successor or predecessor of each
(allowing for manual overrides using the `meta` field).

<!-- ### `buildProgress()`

This should be called as the final step.  It takes the configured timeline and configures the progress tracking (for an optional progress bar you can make visible to participants).  The progress tracking counts the total number of routes, and for the sequential routes converts the order into a percentage complete (e.g., if there were three routes each would add 33% to the total as you step through). -->

Here is an example configuring three sequential routes and one non-sequential
route:

```js
import Timeline from '@/core/timeline'
const timeline = new Timeline()

// first route
timeline.pushSeqView({
  path: '/',
  name: 'welcome',
  component: WelcomeComponent,
})

// second route
timeline.pushSeqView({
  path: '/instructions',
  name: 'instructions',
  component: InstructionsComponent,
})

// third route
timeline.pushSeqView({
  path: '/thanks',
  name: 'thanks',
  component: ThanksComponent,
})

// a non-sequential route available for debugging
timeline.registerView({
  path: '/config',
  name: 'config',
  component: ConfigComponent,
})

timeline.build()
```

During development you can, of course, comment out certain Views to help isolate
and test particular aspects of your experiment. In addition, since Views are
mapped to distinct URLs, it is easy to jump between sections of your experiment
during development (especially using the [developer mode](/developermode)
tools).

## Branching and randomized flows

### Simple branching flows

Sometimes you need timeline structures a little more complex than a simple
sequence. For example, there might be multiple initial landing pages depending
on if you come in from a particular [recruitment](/recruitment) service:

<img src="/images/timeline-flows.png" width="500" alt="timeline example" style="margin: auto;">

To configure this we need multiple routes (1a and 1b in the figure) to all point
to the same successor. We can do this using
[Vue router meta fields](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/meta.html). In
particular, when we create a sequential route we can configure a specific
successor using `meta: {next: 'some_name'}` (or predecessor using
`meta: {prev: 'some_name'}`):

```js
// first route
timeline.pushSeqView({
  name: 'first',
  meta: { next: 'second' }, // this should jump to a specific route (by name)
  component: FirstComponent,
})

// alternative first route
timeline.pushSeqView({
  name: 'first_alternate',
  meta: { next: 'second' }, // this should jump to a specific route (by name)
  component: AlternativeFirstCompomnet,
})

// second route
timeline.pushSeqView({
  name: 'second',
  component: SecondComponent,
})

// third route
timeline.pushSeqView({
  name: 'third',
  component: ThirdComponent,
})

timeline.build()
```

Using this approach, you can configure fairly complex branching flows through
pages.

Note: the `timeline.build()` method steps through all Views pushed using
`pushSeqView()`. For each View, it makes the `next` field in `meta` point to the
next View in the timeline and `prev` field in `meta` point to the previous View
in the timeline. If this is not what you want (because your Views need more
complex flows) you can simply omit the `build` step and set the `next` and
`prev` fields manually for each View.

### Alternative flows and branching

Sometimes you want to randomize the order or presentation of Views. For example,
your experiment might have two tasks, which are presented in a randomized order.
Or, you might have four tasks, and you want one group of participants to see two
of the tasks and the other group to see the other two tasks. We call these
"alternative flows":

<img src="/images/randomizedflows.png" width="500" alt="timeline example" style="margin: auto;">

These alternative flows can be accomplished by adding <b>nodes</b>, which you
can think of as containing several paths of Views and guiding participants along
one of those paths. There are two types of nodes: <i>randomized</i> and
<i>conditional</i>.

#### Randomized nodes

Let's say you want participants to see a page of instructions and then complete
two tasks, which should be presented in a random order across participants.
After the two tasks, you want to show the debrief View. Here's what your
`src/design.js` file might look like:

```js
import RandomSubTimeline from '@/core/subtimeline'
import Timeline from '@/core/timeline'
const timeline = new Timeline()

// push instructions
timeline.pushSeqView({
  name: 'instructions',
  component: Instructions,
})

// register tasks
randTimeline.registerView({
  name: 'task1',
  component: Task1,
})

randTimeline.registerView({
  name: 'task2',
  component: Task2,
})

// push randomized node with the two orderings
timeline.pushRandomizedNode({
  name: 'randomOrder',
  options: [
    ['task1', 'task2'],
    ['task2', 'task1'],
  ],
})

// push debriefing form
timeline.pushSeqView({
  name: 'debrief',
  component: Debrief,
})

timeline.build()
```

Note that the Views that make up each path are <i>registered</i> (added with the
`registerView` method), not <i>pushed</i> (with the `pushSeqView` method). The
node describes the two paths <i>is</i> pushed (with the `pushRandomizedNode`
method).

You can adjust the probabilities of the paths by specifying weights—if you want
the first path to be twice as likely as the second path, for example, you could
do that like this:

```js
timeline.pushRandomizedNode({
  name: 'randomOrder',
  options: [
    ['task1', 'task2'],
    ['task2', 'task1'],
  ],
  weights: [2, 1],
})
```

Note that the weights are automatically normalized, so [2/3, 1/3] or [4, 2]
would generate the same distribution.

#### Conditional nodes

The View order can also be set by which condition the participant is assigned
to, using [random condition assignment](/randomization). This can be more useful
than a simple randomized node if other aspects of the experiment will depend on
the condition. Here's an example:

```js
import Timeline from '@/core/timeline'
const timeline = new Timeline()

// assign participants to condition specifying task order
api.randomAssignCondition({
  taskOrder: ['AB', 'BA'],
})

// push instructions
timeline.pushSeqView({
  name: 'instructions',
  component: Instructions,
})

// push tasks into timeline as "non-sequential" routes
randTimeline.registerView({
  name: 'taskA',
  component: TaskA,
})

randTimeline.registerView({
  name: 'taskB',
  component: TaskB,
})

timeline.pushConditionalNode({
  name: 'ConditionalRandom',
  taskOrder: {
    AB: ['taskA', 'taskB'],
    BA: ['taskB', 'taskA'],
  },
})

timeline.build()
```

It's also possible to have nested nodes. In the example below, there are two
conditions: task order, and variation. Participants first see tasks A and B in a
counterbalanced order (based on the task order condition). Then, separately,
participants are randomly assigned to see either task C or task D afterwards
(based on the variation condition):

```js
import Timeline from '@/core/timeline'
const timeline = new Timeline()

api.randomAssignCondition({
  taskOrder: ['AB', 'BA'],
})

api.randomAssignCondition({
  variation: ['C', 'D'],
})

// the tasks (registered)
timeline.registerView({
  name: 'taskA',
  component: TaskA,
})

timeline.registerView({
  name: 'taskB',
  component: TaskB,
})

timeline.registerView({
  name: 'taskC',
  component: TaskC,
})

timeline.registerView({
  name: 'taskD',
  component: TaskD,
})

timeline.registerConditionalNode({
  name: 'InnerConditionalRandom',
  variation: {
    C: ['taskC'],
    D: ['taskD'],
  },
})

// the outer node (pushed)
timeline.pushConditionalNode({
  name: 'ConditionalRandom',
  taskOrder: {
    AB: ['taskA', 'taskB', 'InnerConditionalRandom'],
    BA: ['taskB', 'taskA', 'InnerConditionalRandom'],
  },
})

timeline.build()
```

## Using the Timeline

### Navigating between Views

So far, we've told you how to set up the Timeline in the `design.js` file. But
how do you actually use the Timeline within each View? How do you get from one
View to the next?

In each View, we need to tell the Timeline when that component is "finished,"
allowing the Timeline to pass control to the next View in the sequence. To do
this, the [API](/api) includes three navigation functions: `goNextView()`,
`goPrevView()`, and `goToView(view_name)`.

Here is a complete, simple SFC component that imports the API and uses it to
advance to the next route in the sequence when the user clicks a button (calling
the `finish()` method):

```vue
<script setup>
import useAPI from '@/core/composables/useAPI'
const api = useAPI()

function finish(goto) {
  api.goNextView()
}
</script>

<template>
  <div class="page">
    <h1 class="title is-3">Experiment</h1>
    <button class="button is-success is-light" id="finish" @click="finish()">
      next &nbsp;<FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-arrow-right" />
    </button>
  </div>
</template>
```

:::warning IMPORTANT (and helpful!)

One important feature of these navigation functions are that they calls
`saveData()` on the global store prior to View changes. So as a result, you can
trust that your data will be saved/synchronized with the persistent store
(Firestore) whenever you navigated between sequential Views. See the data
storage docs on [automatic saving](/datastorage.html#automatic-saving). This
only works if you use the API to advance between Views.

:::

### Navigation permissions

In [developer mode](/developing) any View can be accessed in any order. However,
in live mode (when a participant is accessing the experiment), the timeline
enforces a strict order of Views. This is to prevent participants from
re-starting the experiment or skipping ahead to the end. However, there are some
exceptions to this rule. For example, it is possible to configure any particular
View to the reachable from any other View using the `meta` field
(`allowAlways: true`).

In addition, certain programmatic navigations are always allowed. For example,
if the subject had already read the instructions then if a button or link was
provided like this:

```vue
<a href="/#instructions" class="button">Instructions</a>
```

It would be disallowed in live mode because the subject would be skipping back
using a browser navigation event (to the browser, this will appears the same as
if the subject modified the URL in the browser directly). However, if the same
link was implemented using an internal API navigation function it would be
always allowed:

```js
import useAPI from '@/core/composables/useAPI'
const api = useAPI()

function go_to_instructions() {
  console.log('go')
  api.goToView('instructions')
}
```

```vue
<button class="button" @click="go_to_instructions()">
  Jump to instructions
</button>
```

The premise here is that if the programmer set up a situation where navigation
was requested progamatically, it should be allowed. For the first link type, it
is unclear whether the programmer or the participant constructed the request. As
a result, it should be disallowed.

## Special Set-up Options

### Repeating a task more than once

The View permissions mean that participants move through the phases of your
study in a predictable and determined way. However, at the end of a study they
might be allowed to repeat the task. If you want to allow repeats then you can
set the `VITE_ALLOW_REPEATS` variable in the `env/.env`.

Then, in the last View of your experiment, you can set the `resetApp` field.

```js
// thanks/submit page
timeline.pushSeqView({
  name: 'thanks',
  component: Thanks,
  meta: {
    requiresDone: true,
    resetApp: smilestore.config.allowRepeats,
  },
})
```

When this is set, the _next_ request to the app will reset the app to the start
deleting the local storage and allowing the participant to start the experiment
again. If `VITE_ALLOW_REPEATS` is not set, then the app will not allow a
participant to repeat any part of the task again.

### Running custom code before route loading

Sometimes you want to run a little bit of code prior to loading a View. You can
do this using
[route guards](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html),
a feature of the Vue Router. Route guards are traditionally used to prevent
navigation to a View or redirect it. Here is an example using the <SmileText />
Timeline object.

```js
// welcome screen
timeline.pushSeqView({
  name: 'welcome',
  component: Advertisement,
  beforeEnter: (to, from) => {
    console.log(to, from)
  },
})
```

The `beforeEnter` method will run before the View is loaded. This can be helpful
for doing computation prior to the View loading. For example, after the user
consents to the study it might make sense to create a database record for them.
So we might add a special method to the View _after_ the consent form to handle
that.

It is also possible to register route guards to all Views using the
`.beforeEach()` method. In `src/core/router.js` there is a method `addGuards()`
which has examples of registering global guards.

Note that Vue Router provides a variety of lifecycle hooks that you can
customize for all or individual routes. See the documentation
[here](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html#the-full-navigation-resolution-flow)
for a full accounting of the order in which things occur.

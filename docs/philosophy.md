# ü•∏ Design Philosophy

The design of online experiments (and webpages in general) requires a lot of
complex choices. The goal of <SmileText/> is to make sensible choices as much as
possible so you don't have to think about things. Reflecting on this leads to
several design principles that you should keep in mind while using and
contributing to this project:

## Our goal is to write error-free experiments, happily.

The first point is that we want to write high-quality code which is bug-free
while smiling the whole time ü´† (and not melting too much). We need to do this
because we have a moral obligation both in our scientific papers and to our
participants to not have mistakes in our empirical data collection. Messing up a
model code is bad but at least you didn't waste the time of 1000 subjects and
the money of taxpayers [^moral]. All the subsequent principles are ultimately in
the service of this one.

A great article with tips on this by Rouder, Haaf, and Snyder is available
[here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245918801915).

[^moral]:
    This shouldn't be interpreted as pressure to hide bugs when they happen. An
    even more important factor there is humans are humans, bugs happen, and we
    should fix them and move on even if costly. The goal actually of this
    project is to lower the costs and roadblocks that face us as humans. It's
    not life or death here. The moral imperative is higher for honestly fixing
    things!

## No code is the best code.

> Jeff Atwood: ‚Äúthe best code is no code at all. Every new line of code you
> willingly bring into the world is code that has to be debugged, code that has
> to be read and understood, code that has to be supported. Every time you write
> new code, you should do so reluctantly, under duress, because you completely
> exhausted all your other options.‚Äù

In trying to keep things simple and easy to maintain it is helpful to keep this
old programmer lore in mind. Of course, code has to be written but simple and
intuitive is helpful. Perhaps the biggest example of this is reactive
programming where you simply define how your website component should _look_ and
then the state is updated automatically when things change. Or like if data
needs to be saved from an experiment do it automatically in the background with
some fault tolerance rather than asking the experiment designer to think about
this.

## Leverage open-source web technologies and standards.

The modern web is one of the most highly developed software ecosystems in the
history of the world. Many companies and individuals have invested considerable
time and money in developing tools and libraries that can be used to make your
life easier. The goal of <SmileText/> is to leverage these tools as much as
possible. This means using modern web technologies like Vue.js, Vite, and Bulma
CSS. It also means using open-source libraries and tools that are
well-maintained and have a large community of users. This will make it easier to
develop and maintain your experiment code.

The problem is that if you try to write anything more complex than a simple
"Hello world!" project you quickly start writing your own Javascript framework
(like [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/)). The <SmileText/> philosophy is to
leverage the immense open-source community on the web in the service of better
science!

## Don't sweat the dumb stuff.

There are a lot of stupid things you need to do in developing and deploying
slightly complex software. These things include uploading your files to the
server, etc... Your daily time as a developer of your experiment is better spent
on the code itself and all this stuff should be worked out in advance with
reasonable settings by <SmileText/>.

Here's an example. In the past with psiTurk you called `psiturk.saveData()` when
you wanted to push the current data from your experiment to the database. You
might do this multiple times in the task, often at the end of a block of trials.
However, it could make sense to engineer this so it happens automatically. Now
you as the task developer don't have to think about when to save the data, you
can trust that it has been worked out for you and it means you have one less
thing to think about (or possibly forget!).[^forget]

[^forget]:
    This has happened. Once because a student didn't know they needed to call
    the save data function and another time because they forgot to do it. The
    fact that this happens is an indication that something is wrong in a way
    since there's no point to doing an experiment where you don't save the data
    so why should you even need to think about it? Think about it -- you are
    using a package to help you make experiments and saving the data is left to
    you as an **option**? :monocle_face:

Another example is the
[15-step process](https://psiturk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/heroku.html)
to deploy psiTurk to the Heroku cloud. Instead, it would make sense for
reasonable choices to be made about the configurations and all this to happen in
the background, automatically.

## Don't repeat yourself.

This is known as D.R.Y. This means you shouldn't have copies of your code in two
places. If you are cutting and pasting the same things lots of time then you
should abstract that function into something more reusable. This way updates to
the common part will spread across all the uses.

## Abstraction is your friend.

Related to D.R.Y. is when something becomes useful enough it should be
abstracted into a component, object, or plugin that can be reused by others. As
one example of a failure, in the first version of psiTurk we envisioned most of
it working using a command line. This meant that we had a command-line shell
interpreter that made direct calls to Boto (the library that interfaces to
Amazon Web Services). Later we wanted to make a web dashboard GUI to replace the
command line. However, we had to go back and re-abstract the Mechanical Turk
function into a more general class that could be used by _either_ the command
line or the front end. In the first place, it would have made sense to do that
abstraction. Lesson learned.

## Limit choices so that the only options are to do things correctly.

People hate having to make choices. It is exhausting and you never are quite
sure if you did the right thing. If possible narrow choices so there is just one
(a default) or if you need options keep them reasonable. psiTurk has suffered
from the desire to be all things to all people. As an example, you can run it
locally or on Heroku or AWS. There are instructions for all these options, each
being more complex than the next. It'd make more sense if there was just a
choice made and everyone lives with it. New users hate this complexity and you
are just forcing it on them instead of making the hard decisions yourself.

## Documentation first.

Documentation is often considered to be something you do after you finish
writing your main code. However, this is one reason things are never adequately
documented. When you are writing your code is the best time to write down the
steps you took, the research you did (links to URLs, etc...) and the overall
design considerations you were trying to achieve. These notes can be edited
later to make useful, stable docs for a project. So do the docs then write a
little code, then do more docs, and more code, etc... Also writing documentation
is a check on yourself -- is what you are doing too complex to explain?

## Data must always be linked to the code that created it.

Modern software development largely happens using version control software like
git/GitHub. This is incredibly helpful for keeping track of changes,
collaborating, and documenting code as it is developed. However, version control
also offers the potential of linking empirical data generated using a software
program to the exact version of the software used to create it. This is helpful
for several reasons. First, this makes it trivial to limit data analyses to
participant data from particular code versions (e.g., removing subjects affected
by a bug without looking inside their data file). Second, this is helpful for
replicability since when you share your data and code other scientists can go
back and realize if a bug affected only a subset of participants. In
<SmileText/>, a key design goal is to always provide a way to link the current
code version history to datasets generated from that code. This should happen
automatically so that users don't forget this important step.

## Automate testing.

Having bugs in your experiment code is actually one of the worst things we can
do (see
[error-free code](#our-goal-is-to-write-error-free-experiments-happily)). It
corrupts our measurement, leads to false findings in the field, and wastes our
participant's time and energy. However, stopping bugs is complicated. Perhaps
the best guard against the unintended consequences of changes in a complex code
base is unit tests and integration tests. Use them. Smile aims to remove some of
the cognitive load of other aspects of experiment design so you can focus on
being bug-free as much as possible.

## Don't try to solve every possible problem.

Deciding what things Smile can do and what things it shouldn't (i.e., project
scope) can be hard. It can be a matter of taste. psiTurk tried to do a lot
(front-end development, server-side code, Mechanical Turk API). It is useful to
pull these services together but made things somewhat complex. A better solution
is to find the natural break points in how other people develop systems. Have
pieces that are small and manageable that can be shared between projects.

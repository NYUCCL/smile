# Overview

The following sections describe the features of <SmileText /> that aid with the
graphical design of your experiments.

## Image and Videos

Many experiments present videos or images to participants. We describe how to
distribute [images and videos](/imagesvideo) with your Smile project, how to
preload them so that they appear immediately when needed, and how to display
them in your experiment.

## Styling, CSS, and Icons

Smile uses the Tailwind CSS framework for help with styling interface elements.
This provides nice looking buttons, tables, and other design elements.
[Here](/style) we describe how to use Tailwind to change the look and feel of
your experiments. We also describe how to use icons in your experiments which
add polish and help users understand the interface. Of course, you can style
your components with custom CSS as well or overwrite Smile defaults for your
entire project.

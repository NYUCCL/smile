# :walking_man: Walking through an example

I think these should be videos with some notes along side.

- [ ] Start with default experiment in developer mode and edit something
- [ ] Explain the user folder and design.js
- [ ] Walk through the code of a new experiment component
- [ ] Walk through some of the builtin components
- [ ] Walk though setting up the code

# Welcome to Smile!

The Smile project is new way to develop rich and interactive online experiments.
Smile prioritizes modularity and reusability. Unlike tools that cater to
non-programmers, Smile is designed to help reasonably competent programmers (or
AI-assisted programmers) accomplish more in less time.

### Highlighted features:

- Fast and fun front-end interface development with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org),
  [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and
  [Shadcn/vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/). Make complex games, animations, and
  surveys with ease.
- Custom [API](/api) and [developer mode tools](/coding/developing) which
  provides a novel interface for specifying and debugging interactive
  experiments. Jump quickly between phases and trials in your experiments,
  [autofill forms and generate mock data for testing](/coding/autofill),
  [hot-reload](/coding/developing#hot-module-replacement) the code you are
  working on without restarting the entire experiment, and more!
- Built-in support for
  [common experiment elements](/coding/views#built-in-views) like consent forms,
  instructions, and surveys. Just add your custom experiment logic and start
  collecting data.
- Code writing can be greatly accelerated using AI tools because LLMs are
  trained on extensive codebases covering Vue, Tailwind, and other popular web
  standards used by the project.
- Built-in support for multiple [recruitment services](/recruit/recruitment)
  including Prolific, MTurk, CloudResearch, and more.
- [Data provenance features](/analysis#data-provenance) include an audit trail
  of which version of the code was used to create each data file.
- Great looking and detailed docs, if we do say so ourselves!

The current development is happening at

::: info Find this useful in your work? We have a plan to help you cite it!

We will eventually issue a preferred citation for the project on Aug 1, 2026. It
will be based on the Github contributions list (i.e., contributions to the docs
or code that hits the main branch, or noteworthy helpful interactions on Github
discussions). The author list is open to anyone who contributes substantially.

_Initial project development was supported by National Science Foundation Grant
[BCS-2121102](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2121102&HistoricalAwards=false)
to TM Gureckis._

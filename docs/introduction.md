# Introduction

The goal of ðŸ«  **Smile** is to make it easy and fun to collect behavioral data online.

The project is currently in the development and planning stage. We are taking a "docs first" approach to this project by planning the development within the documentation and then working on implementation. 

The current development is happening at [https://github.com/NYUCCL/smile](https://github.com/NYUCCL/smile).

### Software you will need to install first:

1. You will need to install Node.js on your computer if you haven't already.  You can download the latest version [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  After the install completes, verify that you have the `npm` command in your terminal program of choice.

2. You will also need a GitHub account (free level is fine).  Next, install the GitHub [command line tool](https://cli.github.com).  You can download a standard double-click installer or if you use homebrew type `brew install gh` in your terminal program.  To allow the command-line tool access to your GitHub account authenticate by typing `gh auth login --web` and follow the sign-in instructions.

3. If you are in the [gureckislab](http://gureckislab.org) and want access to the lab databases you will need to install [git-secret](https://git-secret.io) using homebrew: `brew install git-secret`


4. It is recommended that you use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension as your text editor/development environment.

5. Install the [Vue Devtools](https://devtools.vuejs.org) in your browser (e.g., Chrome).

# Welcome to Smile!

The Smile project is new way to develop rich and interactive online experiments.
Smile prioritizes modularity and reusability. Unlike tools that cater to
non-programmers, Smile is designed to help reasonably competent programmers (or
AI-assisted programmers) accomplish more in less time.

### Highlighted features:

- Fast and fun front-end interface development with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org),
  [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and
  [Shadcn/vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/). Make complex games, animations, and
  surveys with ease.
- Custom [API](/api) and [developer mode tools](/coding/developing) which
  provides a novel interface for specifying and debugging interactive
  experiments. Jump quickly between phases and trials in your experiments,
  [autofill forms and generate mock data for testing](/coding/autofill),
  [hot-reload](/coding/developing#hot-module-replacement) the code you are
  working on without restarting the entire experiment, and more!
- Built-in support for
  [common experiment elements](/coding/views#built-in-views) like consent forms,
  captchas, instructions, and surveys. Just add your custom experiment logic and
  start collecting data.
- Code writing can be greatly accelerated using AI tools because LLMs are
  trained on extensive codebases covering Vue, Tailwind, and other popular web
  standards used by the project.
- Built-in support for multiple [recruitment services](/recruit/recruitment)
  including Prolific, MTurk, CloudResearch, and more.
- [Data provenance features](/analysis#data-provenance) include an audit trail
  of which version of the code was used to create each data file.
- Great looking and detailed docs, if we do say so ourselves!

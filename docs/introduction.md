# Introduction

The goal of ðŸ«  **Smile** is to make it easy and fun to collect behavioral data online.

The project is currently in the development and planning stage. We are taking a "docs first" approach to this project by planning the development in the documentation and then working on implementation. 

- The current development is happening at [https://github.com/NYUCCL/smile](https://github.com/NYUCCL/smile).

- It is recommended you use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  and the [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension as your development environment.

- You will also need to install Node.js on your computer if you haven't already.  You can download the latest version [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  Verify that you have the `npm` command in your terminal program of choice.

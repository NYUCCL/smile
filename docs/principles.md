# Design Principles

The design of online experiments (and webpages in general) requires a lot of complex choices.  The goal of ðŸ«  Smile is to make sensible choices about as much as possible so you don't have to think about things.  This leads to several design principles that you should keep in mind while contributing to the project:

1. No code is the best code
1. Don't sweat the dumb stuff
1. Do not repeat yourself
1. Abstraction is your friend
1. Limit choices so that the only options are to do things correctly
1. Sometimes learning 1 seemingly complex thing makes everything you do 10% faster
1. Trust in useful third party services but don't tie yourself to them
1. Automate testing
1. Don't try to solve every possible problem.  Prioritize.

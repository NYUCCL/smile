# :space_invader: Required software you will need to install

Before getting started on a <SmileText/> project you will need to install a few
items on your local computer.

## 1. Install the latest Node.js

You will need to install Node.js on your computer. You can download the latest
version [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). After the install completes,
verify that you have the `npm` command in your terminal program of choice. If
you already have Node installed, verify that the version of npm is greater than
or equal to 10.9.2. You can check your installed version by typing `npm -v`.

## 2. Create a GitHub account if you haven't and install the command-line tool

You will also need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) (a free account
is fine). Next, you will need to install the Github Command Line Intervace
(CLI). You can [download it here](https://cli.github.com) using the installer or
homebrew. Finally, allow CLI access to your GitHub account by typing in your
terminal:

```
gh auth login --web
```

## 3. Install a web browser (or two or three)

Install Safari, Chrome, ARC and/or Firefox. You may want to install multiple
browsers to try out your code in each of them. However, for developing/testing
your code, ARC/Chrome is particularly recommended because of the wide range of
available extensions.

## 4. Install VSCode, Vue Extension for VSCode, and Prettier

It is highly recommended that you use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
the [Vue](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)
extension, and the
[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
extension. These tools will help you write and debug your code more easily.
